Weevely
=======

Weevely is a command line web shell dynamically extended over the network at runtime, designed for remote administration and penetration testing. It provides a ssh-like terminal just dropping a PHP script on the target server, even in restricted environments.

The low footprint agent and over 30 modules shape an extensible framework to administrate web accounts and post exploit web servers escalating privileges and moving laterally in the network.

**Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/epinna/weevely3/wiki#getting-started) for tutorials and uses cases.**

The modules feature:

* Ssh-like terminal
* Run SQL console pivoting on target
* Proxy your HTTP traffic pivoting on target
* Host configurations security auditing
* Mount target file system locally
* Conduct network scans pivoting on target
* File upload and download
* Spawn reverse and direct TCP shells
* Bruteforce internal services
* Manage compressed archives

### The backdoor agent

The remote agent is a small PHP script which can extend its functionality over the network at run-time. The agent code is polymorphic and hardly detectable by AV and the traffic is obfuscated within the HTTP requests.

### Modules development

Weevely also provides python API to develop your own module to implement internal audit, account enumerator, sensitive data scraper, network scanner, make the modules work as a HTTP or SQL client and do a whole lot of other cool stuff.
